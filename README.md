# CS527 SQL Data Mining
A Challenger dataset is used for this practice.

1. Build an univariate user defined function for each of the following univariate statistic:

- Range, Median, Mode, Skewness, Kurtosis
2. Build a bivariate stored procedure for Z Test:

- Input : Table name, Categorical Name, Numerical Column Name
- Output : Z statistics and P(Z)
3. Build a stored procedure for K Nearest Neighbors 

- Input: (Temperature, K)
- Output: K nearest neighbors (Target) with the corresponding probability
The space shuttle Challenger disaster happened when temperature was 30 before launch. What would have been your suggestion regrading the probability of O-Ring failure using your KNN model with K=3
